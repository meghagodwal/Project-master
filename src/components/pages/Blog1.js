      <tr ><td colspan="2"><p>The feature that gets the most attention when Apple presents new iPhones these days is the camera. The reason for this is obvious: there isn’t much room left for progress in a smartphone. Yes, the processor is faster, the display may be a bit better, the battery lasts longer, and the audio is improved, but these small, incremental changes aren’t enough to sway most people.

However, new features such as the ultra-wide lens on the iPhone 11, or the triple camera on the iPhone 11 Pro, give consumers new, improved technologies in a feature that, for many users, is essential. Smartphones are rarely used for phone calls anymore; and while the camera is not the essential element in a smartphone—arguably, what's most critical is the device's ability to access the internet—it is nevertheless a widely used feature. Given the way Apple promotes the new iPhone, it could almost be called the Apple iCamera.

Apple has segregated the two models of the iPhone 11 according to the camera features they offer. The Pro models contain much more than just a third camera, but that additional camera is the most obvious difference. And here, Apple has made an interesting separation. With previous two-camera iPhones, you had a standard lens and a telephoto lens to zoom in on distant subjects. Now, the two-camera model, the iPhone 11, has a wide and an ultra-wide lens; the Pro models have all three: ultra-wide, wide, and telephoto.

      <tr><td colspan="2"><p>The new iPhone 11 Pro comes with a triple-lens system compared to the dual-lens setup of the iPhone 11 ("non-pro"). You'll find the following lenses on the iPhone 11 Pro:

A new ultra-wide lens with f/2.4 aperture and a 120-degree field of view.
A standard wide lens with f/1.4
A 2x telephone lens with an f/2.0 aperture.
Those numbers look impressive. Especially the ultra-wide lens that covers a 120-degree field of view sounds promising.

So, here are two series of sample photos I took from the same spot without zooming in or out with my feet. I didn't edit those photos much and didn't crop them, so you get to see the full-frame.

From left to right you'll find a photo taken with the 2x telephoto lens, the 1x wide lens, and the 0.5x ultra-wide lens. Click any photo to view it large.
On iPhone 11 Pro, the iOS camera app has a new feature that's called shoot outside the frame. As of now, the function is exclusively available for the iOS camera app, and no third party app has this feature (yet?). So how does this feature work?

First, you need to enable it in the camera settings:

In Settings, tap Camera
Under Composition turn on Photos Capture Outside the Frame
Then, when you take a photo with the telephoto lens, iPhone will automatically take a photo with the wide lens. Likewise, when you take a photo with the wide lens, iPhone 11 will automatically take a photo with the ultra-wide lens.

Now you have 30 days to use that additional photo. After 30 days, that extra photo will be deleted. To identify a photo that has a photo outside the frame, look for the icon in the upper right corner. The icon is only visible if you view a photo large. You won't see it in the thumbnail view.</p></td></tr>

      <tr><td colspan="2"><p >iPhone 11 Pro Max sports 6.5-inch super retina XRD OLED display and you’ve sure watch everything on it! Now, if you’re looking forward to protecting your Pro Max and don’t want to lose the original beauty, the clear case is your way to go!

Protecting the iPhone with a transparent case and ensuring it doesn’t look bulky can be an arduous task. But don’t you worry, we’ve got some of the best iPhone 11 Pro Max clear cases reviewed today. You can choose the one that suits your asset as per your requirements.

The assumption seems to be that most people don’t need the telephoto lens, and perhaps this may be the case. The ultra-wide lens is better at taking close-up pictures such as of groups of people. In addition, a wider angle lens offers better depth of field — items further away remain more in focus — and this probably suits casual photography a lot more. However, if you do want all three options, then you have to pay the price for the Pro models.
